# CHAPTER 01: THE BASICS

## 1. Breaking with Tradition

## 2. Starting with a meatier example

## 3. Jump right in

## 4. Python's IDLE is all you need to get going

## 5. Understanding IDLE's Windows

## 6. What happens next ...

## 7. Presss F5 to run your code

## 8. Code Runs Immediately

### a. Oh, good catch. That is confusing.

## 9. Excuting code, one statement at a time

### a. Let's be the Python interpreter

## 10. Functions + modules = the standard library

## 11. Batteries included

### a. Yes. That's what they mean.

## 12. Data structures come built-in

### a. Python variables are dynamically assigned

## 13. Invoking methods obtains results

### a. Invoking built-in module functionality

## 14. Deciding when to run blocks of code

### a. Blocks in Python are easy to spot, as they are always indented

## 15. What happened to my curly braces?

### a. A colon introduces an indented suite of code

## 16. What "else" can you have with "if"?

### a. Neither. Python spells it elif

```python
if today == 'Saturday':
  print('Party!!')
elif today == 'Sunday':
  print('Recover.')
else:
  print('Work, work, work.')
```

## 17. Suites can contain embedded suites

```python
if  today == 'Saturday':
  println('Party!')
elif today == 'Sunday':
  if condition == 'Headache':
    println('Recover, then rest.')
  else:
    print('Rest.')
else:
  print('Work, work, work.')
```

## 18. What we already know

## 19. Extending our program to do more

## 20. What's the b√©t approach to solving this problem?

### a. Both approaches work with Python

## 21. Returning to the Python Shell

## 22. Experimenting at the shell
